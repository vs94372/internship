step 1 - The columns "posteam," "time," and "desc" are where I found missing values.
step 2- In the "posteam" column, I fill in "Na" in place of blank cells. In the "time" column, I use the median formula to replace blank cells. In the "desc" column, I fill in "No."
step 3 - In this process, I use outliers. First, we arrange the data in ascending order. Then, from the "yardsgain" column, we determine Q1 and Q3. Next, we calculate the Interquartile Range (IQR) using the formula IQR = Q3 - Q1. After that, we find the lower bound and upper bound. Once we have both values, we highlight the cells that fall between the lower bound and upper bound values. We repeat the same steps for the remaining columns "postteamscore" and "scorediff."
step 4 - In this process, I sorted the data in a regular format, aligning it on the left side. I used a text formula to standardize the table, and in the "desc" column, I applied the proper formula to ensure the data was in the correct format. For the "date" column, I ensured that all entries were formatted consistently throughout the entire column.
step 5 - After that, I removed all duplicates from the entire table.
step 6 - After that, I performed feature engineering by creating a new column. I extracted years from the date column and weekdays from the date column using Excel's text formulas.
I created a dashboard using Excel, featuring graphs that show the number of penalized players per year, the number of matches played by each team, and the distribution of matches played over different times. Additionally, the dashboard includes data on the number of fumbles per season, the number of first downs by year, and finally, the count of games played each week.
